# Student Credit Assessment System

## What is Student Credit Assessment System?
This system enables teachers to assess students' past course credits to decide their eligibility
for new courses. Features include credit verification, automated decisions, secure data handling,
and a user-friendly interface for managing student applications and course requirements.


### Purpose - Why?
A student may wish to continue their course of study or enroll on a new one. Most educational
institutions have requirements for students to meet before they can get accepted into a certain
course. This program is developed to make it easier for assessors to perform an assessment based
on a student's past studies.


### Why a program?
Yes, assessors can manually check and assess each student enrolling on a new course, but this may
only work for a small educational institution. If there is only one or two assessors, and there are
say 1000 students enrolling for a course next year, it can get difficult for assessors.


### How will it help?
By storing a student's past assessment of whether they got accepted or rejected on a new course
based on their past courses, an assessor can have an idea of how they will accept/reject the next
similar student. This significantly decreases the time it takes for an assessor to assess a
student depending on how many students are enrolling and how similar each students' past courses
are.
